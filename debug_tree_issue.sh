# Provide troubleshooting steps

echo "1. Check the actual work directory for your tree building task:"
echo "   find work/ -name 'BUILD_PHYLOGENETIC_TREE_PARSNP*' -type d"
echo ""
echo "2. Look at the command log:"
echo "   cat work/*/BUILD_PHYLOGENETIC_TREE_PARSNP/.command.log"
echo ""
echo "3. Check what files are in the work directory:"
echo "   ls -la work/*/BUILD_PHYLOGENETIC_TREE_PARSNP/"
echo ""
echo "4. Look for QC output:"
echo "   cat work/*/BUILD_PHYLOGENETIC_TREE_PARSNP/*.Tree_Output_File.tsv"
echo ""
echo "5. Check if the file was removed by QC:"
echo "   grep -i 'QC.*FAIL\\|removed\\|too small' work/*/BUILD_PHYLOGENETIC_TREE_PARSNP/.command.log"
echo ""

# Provide potential solutions
echo "üí° Potential Solutions:"
echo ""
echo "If the file is being incorrectly removed:"
echo ""
echo "1. **Lower the minimum size threshold:**"
echo "   Edit modules/local/build_phylogenetic_tree_parsnp/params.config"
echo "   Change: min_tree_filesize = '100c'"
echo "   To:     min_tree_filesize = '50c'"
echo ""
echo "2. **Check for file naming issues:**"
echo "   The script looks for files matching '*.Final.tree'"
echo "   Verify your tree file has the correct name pattern"
echo ""
echo "3. **Disable size check temporarily:**"
echo "   Comment out the QC check in the tree building module"
echo "   to see if the file gets published"
echo ""
echo "4. **Check the find command syntax:**"
echo "   The size check uses: find -L \"\${file}\" -type f -size +\"\${min_size}\""
echo "   This might have issues with the 'c' suffix"
echo ""

echo "üéØ Quick Fix:"
echo "If you want to bypass the size check for now, you can:"
echo "1. Copy the tree file manually from the work directory"
echo "2. Or modify the minimum size to be smaller than your file"
echo ""
echo "Your 1.33kb tree file should be perfectly valid!"
